/**
 * Tests for the shared `withLease` / `withPrivateLease` lease wrappers
 * (apps/api/src/lib/blob.ts:149-195).
 *
 * Three concerns:
 *
 *  1. Serialization (CHARACTERIZATION, GREEN against current code) — driven by a
 *     REAL Azurite lease (Azurite up on :10000). Two sequential `withLease`
 *     calls each acquire+release; a contention case where a second acquire
 *     while the blob is already leased yields HTTP 409.
 *
 *  2. Guarded success-release (NEW behavior, RED until T8) — when `fn` succeeds
 *     but `releaseLease()` throws, `withLease` should RESOLVE with `fn`'s result
 *     and attempt release exactly once. Today the success-path `await
 *     leaseClient.releaseLease()` is UNGUARDED, so the rejection propagates and
 *     `fn`'s result is discarded — this case FAILS until T8 mirrors the
 *     `withLeaseRenewingOnClient` guarded `finally` (blob.ts:264-273).
 *
 *  3. Error-path release stays best-effort (GREEN now) — when `fn` throws,
 *     `fn`'s error propagates and the release failure is swallowed.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (T2 probe finding): real Azurite `releaseLease()` on a broken /
 * expired lease does NOT throw. The guarded-release and error-path cases
 * therefore drive release failure via a MOCKED lease client whose
 * `releaseLease` rejects — a real broken lease would make these tests vacuous.
 * The mocked cases use `vi.doMock` (non-hoisted) + `vi.resetModules()` + a
 * dynamic `import("../blob.js")` so they do NOT disturb the real
 * `@azure/storage-blob` used by the serialization cases (which rely on the
 * statically-imported, real `withLease`/`writeBlob`).
