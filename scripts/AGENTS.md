# scripts — admin, migration, load-test, and CI-gate scripts

Node ESM scripts run from the root `bccweb2` package; `scripts/migrate/` is a standalone
package outside the workspace graph. See root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the storage/queue
architecture these scripts operate on, and
[docs/architecture/storage-and-queues.md](../docs/architecture/storage-and-queues.md) for
the full container/queue reference.

## Credential safety (`make seed`)

`make seed` bootstraps `admin@bcc.local` and writes its generated credential only to the
gitignored root `.dev-credentials` at mode 0600; the value is never logged. Subsequent
seed/load control scripts consume that file automatically. `ADMIN_PASSWORD` remains the
explicit override. Malformed, symlinked, foreign-owned, or non-0600 files fail before any
API/storage mutation — treat this as a hard security invariant, not a convenience check.

For `make docker-up`, prepare writes the override (when present) into that same private
bind-mounted file, never into Compose environment. Make passes only the host UID/GID to
the root `api-init` container; credential reads accept that exact host owner across the
Linux bind boundary while retaining the regular-file, no-follow, single-link, and 0600
checks. Docker Desktop root-owned mounts still satisfy the normal current-owner path.

## `init-storage.mjs` — fatal, uniform provisioning

Creates the two blob containers and all ten Storage Queues (see the architecture doc)
in Azurite, using only Node built-ins (Shared Key auth against the Blob/Queue REST APIs —
no SDK). All ten queues are created uniformly **fatally**: if the Queue service is
unreachable the script throws and exits non-zero, exactly like `round-brief-pdf`. Blob
containers are created earlier in the same run, so a queue-service outage still surfaces
as a hard failure rather than a silent partial success.

## `privacy-scan.mjs` — CI success gate

Fails CI if PII leaks into public blobs, the SPA bundle, or telemetry/log fixtures. Its
storage scan covers public **blob storage** only — it does **not** cover Storage Queues (see the
architecture doc's "Queue privacy" section for the compensating control: strict `.strict()`
job schemas in `apps/api/src/lib/{queue,rescoreJob}.ts` and
`packages/schemas/src/igcValidationJob.ts`, including the IGC-validation family's
`IgcValidationJobSchema`). PII field list lives in
[`scripts/lib/pii.mjs`](lib/pii.mjs) and must stay in sync with
`apps/api/src/lib/telemetryRedactor.ts`'s `PII_FIELDS`.

## `spdx-header.mjs` — SPDX checker

Bespoke, zero-dependency checker. Enumerates tracked files via `git ls-files`; chained
into `npm run lint` (local + the CI `lint` job — no separate workflow). See root
AGENTS.md's "License headers (SPDX)" section for the header format and scope.
`npm run license:fix` stamps/upgrades in place (idempotent); `license:check` verifies
only; `license:test` runs the checker's own `node:test` suite.

## `scripts/migrate/` — standalone package

Legacy .NET → blob migration tooling. It sits **outside** the root `workspaces` globs and
has its **own** `package-lock.json` (pulls `mssql`, kept out of the deployed tree). Root
`npm ci` skips it entirely; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs it separately to run its
unit tests. State lives under `.migration-state/` (gitignored). `scripts/admin/anonymize-pilot.mjs`
handles GDPR erasure — see `docs/runbooks/gdpr-erasure.md`.

## Load-test scripts

`prepare-loadtest.mjs`, `run-loadtest.mjs`, `set-captains-loadtest.mjs`,
`transition-loadtest.mjs`, `verify-loadtest-sign-artifacts.mjs`,
`verify-loadtest-signtofly.mjs`, `cleanup-loadtest.mjs` implement the phases the
persisted status ledger tracks (`prepare/register/captains/transition/sign/artifact/verify/cleanup`).
`make loadtest` is a single sequential Node orchestrator recipe
(`node scripts/run-loadtest.mjs`) — individual `loadtest-*` Make targets remain
diagnostic-only tools, not composable parallel steps. Full topology, fixture counts, and
gate thresholds live in [docs/runbooks/load-testing.md](../docs/runbooks/load-testing.md)
— read it before touching these scripts. `npm run loadtest:test`
(`scripts/__tests__/loadtest-*.test.mjs`) covers pure orchestration/artifact/static
contracts without k6 or Azurite; it also parses this repo's root AGENTS.md, `tests/load/README.md`,
and the load-testing runbook. It checks the phase sequence in each document, while other
policy claims are checked across their combined text; keep all three aligned.

## Other key scripts

`seed-fixtures.mjs` / `seed-rounds.mjs` / `seed-admin.mjs` / `seed-wording.mjs` — fixture
and reference-data seeding (see root AGENTS.md's `make seed` / `make seed-rounds`).
`audit-fixtures.mjs`, `wipe-fixtures.mjs`, `perf-check.mjs`, `admin-users.mjs` —
maintenance/diagnostic one-offs; read the file header comment before running any of them
against a non-local target.

`admin/move-manufacturers-to-public.mjs` performs the one-time, idempotent promotion of
`manufacturers.json`; follow [the runbook](../docs/runbooks/manufacturers-move.md).
`admin/reconcile-orphan-igcs.mjs` scans private `rounds/*.json` as the authoritative
IGC reference set, then reports unreferenced `flight-igcs/**` blobs older than 24 hours;
it is dry-run by default and deletes only with explicit `--delete` (see the privacy runbook).
`admin/redispatch-stuck-igc-validations.mjs` reports pending, non-manual IGC validation
attempts whose round has been unchanged for at least two hours and has no durable result;
it is dry-run by default and reuses the committed attempt ID only with explicit
`--redispatch` (see the privacy runbook).
`devtools/seed-qa-users.mjs` is test-user tooling, not production seeding.
