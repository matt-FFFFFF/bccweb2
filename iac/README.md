# iac — Terraform Infrastructure

This directory manages the Azure resources for bccweb2 using a declarative,
three-root layout: `bootstrap/` (one-shot state backend + identities + resource
groups), `shared/` (the platform layer shared by `staging`/`prod`: Log Analytics,
per-env Application Insights, Azure Communication Services, and the Standard
Static Web App), and `environment/` (the per-environment application stamp).

All infrastructure is provisioned using **AzAPI v2.10** with HCL-native bodies.

## Layout

- `bootstrap/`: One-shot config provisioning the remote state storage account, the per-env Terraform UMIs (GitHub OIDC, RG-scoped Owner), the shared resource group plus one stamp resource group per application environment, and the GitHub environment secrets/variables. Uses **local state** (it provisions its own remote-state target, so it cannot live there itself). See [bootstrap/README.md](bootstrap/README.md).
- `shared/`: The platform layer used by the stable `staging`/`prod` environments — Sweden Central Log Analytics, per-environment Application Insights, and Azure Communication Services, plus one Standard-tier Static Web App in West Europe (the nearest supported SWA region, with production custom domain/DNS). One remote state, `shared.tfstate`. See [shared/README.md](shared/README.md).
- `environment/`: Per-env application stack, composed of a single `modules/stamp` child module (storage — two accounts, see below — Flex Consumption Function App, Key Vault, alerts, optional DNS). It reads only non-secret `app_insights_ids`/`acs_id` from the `shared` root's remote state. One `terraform apply` provisions the stamp for a given environment. See [environment/README.md](environment/README.md).
- `env/`: Committed environment-specific configuration — `<env>.backend.hcl`, non-secret base values in `<env>.tfvars`, and bootstrap's non-secret `shared.generated.tfvars`. Secrets are supplied through explicit workflow `TF_VAR_*` environment mappings. The generated shared file is intentionally absent until bootstrap first applies, then must be reviewed and committed.

Bootstrap and the committed backend files use one canonical layout: storage
account `stbccweb13afe`, with one private `tfstate-<env>` container and one
`<env>.tfstate` blob per environment (including `tfstate-shared`).
`local_file.backend_config` writes the
same authoritative `iac/env/<env>.backend.hcl` path used by commands and
workflows. Every backend authenticates with Azure AD; shared-key access is
disabled on the account.

## State ownership

- **Bootstrap**: local state only, by design — it creates the storage account that everything else's remote state lives in.
- **Shared**: one remote state, `shared.tfstate`, in `tfstate-shared`. The shared UMI owns that container via Contributor; `staging`/`prod` receive Storage Blob Data Reader on it (read-only remote-state consumption).
- **Environment**: one remote state per environment, `<env>.tfstate`, in its own `tfstate-<env>` container in the storage account bootstrap creates. Each environment UMI has Storage Blob Data Contributor on only its own container. The documented `tf_tfstate_blob_account_reader` (does not exist / stale) account-wide grant was never present.

Bootstrap owns the shared resource group and every environment's stamp resource group. Downstream stacks never create or discover their own resource groups — they consume the names as plain Terraform inputs (`shared_rg_name`, `stamp_rg_name`). Both names are deterministic once `terraform_umis`/`github_environments` are fixed, so they're committed, non-secret values in `iac/env/{shared,staging,prod}.tfvars` — CI's Terraform applies read them straight from that `-var-file`, no GitHub variable involved. Bootstrap separately publishes `TF_VAR_STAMP_RG_NAME`/`SHARED_RG_NAME`/`AZURE_LOCATION` as GitHub Actions environment **variables** on `staging`/`prod`, but those feed `deploy-app.yml`'s `az` CLI steps (application deploy, not Terraform) — see the contract table below.

## Storage split (per environment)

Each environment's stamp has **two storage accounts** — infra-only split, no app-code
change (the API still uses one shared `BlobServiceClient` per connection string, so the
public/private containers can't themselves be split across accounts):

- **Account A** `stbccweb<env>rt` — backs `AzureWebJobsStorage`: runtime host storage,
  all ten queues, and the Flex Consumption `deploymentpackage` container.
- **Account B** `stbccweb<env>data` — backs `BLOB_CONNECTION_STRING`: the `data`
  (public) and `data-private` containers.

See [docs/architecture/storage-and-queues.md](../docs/architecture/storage-and-queues.md).

## First-time Setup

Follow these steps to provision the topology from scratch.

1.  **Authenticate**: Run `az login` to set the subscription context.
2.  **Bootstrap (human-run, one-shot)**:
    See [bootstrap/README.md](bootstrap/README.md) for detailed steps.
    `iac/bootstrap/terraform.tfvars` is the canonical, non-secret file and is
    already committed to this repo — only copy `terraform.tfvars.example`
    over it for a fork or a from-scratch subscription that needs different
    `tfstate_storage_account_name`/`terraform_umis` values:
    ```bash
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=<a token with Actions/Environments/Secrets: write>
    terraform -chdir=iac/bootstrap init -backend=false
    terraform -chdir=iac/bootstrap apply
    ```
    With the default `manage_github_secrets = true`, this apply creates each
    env's UMI, its resource group(s), its GitHub environment, the three
    Azure OIDC secrets (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`/`AZURE_TENANT_ID`/`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`),
    application deploy variables `TF_VAR_STAMP_RG_NAME`/`AZURE_LOCATION`/
    `SHARED_RG_NAME` on `staging`/`prod` (with `AZURE_LOCATION` sourced from
    the Sweden Central workload location; consumed by `deploy-app.yml`, and
    `SHARED_RG_NAME` also by `pr-preview.yml`; not Terraform). It also writes the complete UMI
    principal-ID map to `iac/env/shared.generated.tfvars` with mode 0644.
    That file is non-secret but cannot exist before bootstrap creates the
    identities; review and commit it after every bootstrap change. Everything
    else Terraform needs to know about the topology (`shared_rg_name`,
    `stamp_rg_name`, the `tfstate_*` values) is committed directly in
    `iac/env/{shared,staging,prod}.tfvars`.
    Without a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, set `manage_github_secrets = false` and wire
    those values into GitHub manually — see [bootstrap/README.md](bootstrap/README.md).
3.  **Review and commit bootstrap's generated shared inputs**:
    `iac/env/shared.tfvars` is the committed, tracked base — it already has
    the ACS email domain, `shared_rg_name`, and empty DNS placeholders filled
    in; don't re-copy the example over it. Bootstrap writes the principal IDs
    that do not exist before its first apply to the separate non-secret,
    mode-0644 `iac/env/shared.generated.tfvars`:
    ```bash
    test -f iac/env/shared.generated.tfvars
    git diff --no-index /dev/null iac/env/shared.generated.tfvars || test $? -eq 1
    git add iac/env/shared.generated.tfvars
    ```
    Review the exact identity map before committing it. Its absence is expected
    before the first bootstrap apply, but shared local and workflow plans cannot
    run until it exists in the checkout; ordinary PR contract tests do not run
    a shared remote plan and therefore do not require a fabricated placeholder.
    If your intended ACS email domain differs from the committed
    `acs_email_domain`/`acs_sender_address` in `iac/env/shared.tfvars`, edit
    that committed base file directly (the sender address domain must equal
    `acs_email_domain`). Leave the production hostname/DNS values empty
    until DNS cutover. There is no shared local overlay and no GitHub
    Terraform-variable fallback; see [shared/README.md](shared/README.md).
4.  **Apply the shared root**:
    ```bash
    terraform -chdir=iac/shared init -backend-config=../env/shared.backend.hcl
    terraform -chdir=iac/shared apply -var-file=../env/shared.tfvars -var-file=../env/shared.generated.tfvars
    ```
    This provisions the Log Analytics workspace, per-environment Application
    Insights, Azure Communication Services, and the Standard SWA.
5.  **Prepare the environment root's local overlay**: the canonical backend
    file (`iac/env/<env>.backend.hcl`) is committed and may also be generated
    by bootstrap at that same path. `iac/env/staging.tfvars` is already the
    committed base — stamp name, location, CORS origins, secret-version
    bumps, and the deterministic topology (`stamp_rg_name`,
    `tfstate_resource_group_name`, `tfstate_storage_account_name`). Only
    secrets (`ops_email`, `puretrack_*`, plus the optional Slack webhook)
    live in a gitignored local overlay. Copy its template and fill in the
    required placeholders:
    ```bash
    cp iac/env/staging.local.tfvars.example iac/env/staging.local.tfvars
    ```
    CI loads the committed base file with `-var-file` and supplies the same
    secrets through explicit `TF_VAR_*` job-environment mappings in
    `terraform-run.yml`; GitHub Secrets cannot be read back, so a local
    overlay is filled by hand.
6.  **Principal type**: `terraform_principal_type` defaults to
    `"ServicePrincipal"` because CI (GitHub Actions → per-env Terraform UMI
    via OIDC, see
    [bootstrap/README.md](bootstrap/README.md#github-actions-oidc-setup)) is
    the primary apply path. Local applies as yourself (`az login` as a
    user) MUST override to `"User"` — the Key Vault Secrets Officer role
    assignment (`keyvault.tf`) uses this to pick the correct
    `principalType`, and it will be wrong for a human principal otherwise.
    `terraform_principal_type` is **never committed** — not in
    `iac/env/<env>.tfvars` nor in `iac/env/<env>.local.tfvars.example` —
    so every local `iac/environment` apply/plan command in this document
    passes it as an explicit `-var 'terraform_principal_type=User'` CLI
    override after both `-var-file` flags. The shared root has no
    caller-scoped role assignment and needs no such override.
7.  **Deploy the environment stamp**:
    ```bash
    gh workflow run terraform.yml -f env=staging -f action=apply
    # or locally:
    terraform -chdir=iac/environment init -backend-config=../env/staging.backend.hcl
    terraform -chdir=iac/environment apply -var-file=../env/staging.tfvars -var-file=../env/staging.local.tfvars -var 'terraform_principal_type=User'
    ```
    This apply provisions the stamp module (storage — two accounts, Flex
    Consumption Function App, Key Vault, alerts) for the given environment,
    reading Application Insights and ACS identifiers from `iac/shared`'s
    remote state.

    Staging may be provisioned initially with `allowed_origins = []`; this emits
    no Blob Storage CORS rule and is therefore not ready for browser SPA use.
    Once the one shared SWA exists, read its Azure-assigned hostname with
    `terraform -chdir=iac/shared output -raw swa_default_hostname`, commit
    `allowed_origins = ["https://<that-hostname>"]` to
    `iac/env/staging.tfvars`, and re-apply staging before using the SPA. The
    shared SWA serves stable environment deployments and PR previews while
    deploy automation maps each environment's Function App backend to it.

    After the shared apply, register the registrar DNS records printed by
    `terraform -chdir=iac/shared output acs_dns_records_for_operator` so
    Azure Communication Services can verify the email domain. Once Azure
    reports the domain verified, set `link_acs_email_domain = true` in the
    committed shared tfvars and re-apply — see
    [environment/README.md](environment/README.md#acs-domain-verification).

    **Note on RBAC Propagation**: On the very first apply, you might
    encounter a `403 Forbidden` error when writing secrets to Key Vault.
    This is caused by Azure RBAC propagation lag. Simply re-run the apply
    to resolve it.

## Secret Rotation

Secrets are managed declaratively. Rotating them means editing the version
variables in the committed base file, `iac/env/<env>.tfvars`, and re-applying
`iac/environment` — both locally and in CI, since CI loads the same committed
base with `-var-file`. There is no GitHub-variable alternative for these
values; they are authored, non-secret, and live only in the tracked tfvars.

-   **JWT Secret**: Bump `jwt_secret_version` (e.g., `"1"` → `"2"`). Terraform generates a new random password and updates Key Vault.
-   **ACS Connection String**: Rotate the access key in the Azure portal, then bump `acs_secret_version`. Terraform fetches the new key and updates Key Vault.
-   **App Insights Connection String**: This string does not rotate. It flows from the `iac/shared` root's Application Insights output into the stamp's Key Vault copy via a direct `data.azapi_resource` read — no ephemeral cross-stack secret ever crosses the state boundary.

## Adding a New Environment

To add a new application environment (e.g., a second `staging`-like env):

1.  Add a `terraform_umis` entry (+ the matching `github_environments` name) in `iac/bootstrap/terraform.tfvars` and re-apply bootstrap — this creates the env's UMI, its stamp resource group, its GitHub environment, the OIDC secrets, the application deploy variables (`TF_VAR_STAMP_RG_NAME`/`AZURE_LOCATION`/`SHARED_RG_NAME`) for `deploy-app.yml`, and regenerates `iac/env/shared.generated.tfvars` with the new UMI. Review and commit that generated file before planning shared.
2.  Select the new environment's string from the list-valued bootstrap output, then paste it into a committed `iac/env/<env>.backend.hcl`:
    ```bash
    env=<newenv>
    terraform -chdir=iac/bootstrap output -json backend_config_hcl |
      jq -er --arg env "$env" '.[] | select(contains("iac/env/\($env).backend.hcl"))'
    ```
    Also commit both a non-secret `iac/env/<env>.tfvars` base file — including
    the deterministic topology (`stamp_rg_name`,
    `tfstate_resource_group_name`, `tfstate_storage_account_name`) that
    bootstrap's outputs make knowable up front — and an
    `iac/env/<env>.tfvars.example` full-schema reference, plus a gitignored
    `iac/env/<env>.local.tfvars.example` template documenting the
    secrets-only overlay for local applies.
3.  `terraform.yml`'s `env` input is a `[shared, staging, prod]` choice list (see `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`) — adding a fourth application environment requires extending that choice list (a workflow-file change). Until that lands, apply the new environment locally only:
    ```bash
    cp iac/env/<env>.local.tfvars.example iac/env/<env>.local.tfvars
    terraform -chdir=iac/environment init -backend-config=../env/<env>.backend.hcl
    terraform -chdir=iac/environment apply -var-file=../env/<env>.tfvars -var-file=../env/<env>.local.tfvars -var 'terraform_principal_type=User'
    ```

State is isolated per environment within the bootstrap storage account: each
`<env>.tfstate` blob lives in its own `tfstate-<env>` container. Each environment
UMI has Storage Blob Data Contributor only on that container, so it cannot read
or overwrite another environment's state. The old
`tf_tfstate_blob_account_reader` (does not exist / stale) account-level grant
was a documentation error, not a Terraform resource.

## GitHub Environment Variables & Secrets Contract

Each GitHub environment needs a specific set of secrets/variables: the OIDC
identifiers every root's Terraform apply needs, operator secrets Terraform
applies consume, and — for `staging`/`prod` — the application deploy variables
`deploy-app.yml` reads (`SHARED_RG_NAME` is also used by `pr-preview.yml`).
**Bootstrap-published**
entries are written automatically by `iac/bootstrap` (`manage_github_secrets
= true`); **operator-set** entries have no source of truth in Terraform and
must be added manually (repo Settings → Environments → `<env>` →
Variables/Secrets).

**Deterministic topology is committed tfvars, not a GitHub entry.** Every
value that's knowable once `terraform_umis`/`github_environments` are fixed
— `shared_rg_name`, `stamp_rg_name`, `tfstate_resource_group_name`,
`tfstate_storage_account_name`, plus every authored config value
(`production_hostname`, `dns_zone_name`, `dns_zone_resource_group_name`,
`allowed_origins`, `jwt_secret_version`, `acs_secret_version`,
`blob_schema_mode`, `acs_email_domain`, `acs_sender_address`) — lives only in
the committed base tfvars (`iac/env/<env>.tfvars`). Both local applies and CI
load that same file with `-var-file`; there is no GitHub-side duplicate to
keep in sync, and rotating one of these values (e.g. bumping
`jwt_secret_version`) means editing the base file and re-applying, not
touching GitHub. The bootstrap-created UMI object IDs live in the reviewed,
committed `iac/env/shared.generated.tfvars`; no Terraform input is supplied by
a GitHub Actions variable.

| Name | Kind | Environments | Bootstrap-published or operator-set |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`/`AZURE_TENANT_ID`/`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Secret | all | Bootstrap-published (OIDC identifiers, not real secrets) |
| `TF_VAR_STAMP_RG_NAME` | Variable | `staging`, `prod` | Bootstrap-published (consumed by `deploy-app.yml`'s `az` CLI steps — **not** a Terraform input; `iac/environment`'s `stamp_rg_name` is committed in `iac/env/<env>.tfvars` instead) |
| `SHARED_RG_NAME` | Variable | `staging`, `prod` | Bootstrap-published (consumed by `deploy-app.yml`; Terraform's `shared_rg_name` is committed in `iac/env/shared.tfvars` instead) |
| `AZURE_LOCATION` | Variable | `staging`, `prod` | Bootstrap-published (consumed by `deploy-app.yml`; Terraform's `location` is committed in `iac/env/<env>.tfvars` instead) |
| `TF_VAR_ops_email` | **Secret** | `staging`, `prod` | Operator-set (public repo — kept as a Secret, not a Variable, even though it isn't sensitive) |
| `TF_VAR_puretrack_api_key`, `TF_VAR_puretrack_email`, `TF_VAR_puretrack_password` | Secret | `staging`, `prod` | Operator-set |
| `TF_VAR_slack_webhook_url` | Secret | `staging`, `prod` | Operator-set (optional, defaulted) |
| `AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_NAME` | Variable | `staging`, `prod` | Operator-set |
| `VITE_BLOB_BASE_URL` | Variable | `staging`, `prod` | Operator-set |
| `WEB_HOST` | Variable | `prod` | Operator-set (production web hostname for the deploy-app.yml production-domain smoke; set only when a custom domain is enabled) |

Required-value validation is Terraform-native: `iac/shared` and
`iac/environment` variables carry `validation` blocks (e.g.
`shared_rg_name`, `stamp_rg_name`, `ops_email`, `puretrack_*`,
`env_umi_principal_ids`) that reject empty/whitespace values at plan time —
`terraform-run.yml` no longer runs a separate shell pre-check. For shared
plans, its explicit `-var-file=../env/shared.tfvars` is supplemented by
shared-only `TF_CLI_ARGS_plan=-var-file=../env/shared.generated.tfvars`;
Terraform resolves that relative path inside `iac/shared` because the command
uses `-chdir`. Environment plans receive an empty `TF_CLI_ARGS_plan` and load
only their committed target base. Applying `tfplan` uses the saved plan's
resolved variables and must not repeat either var-file.

## Tests

-   **Unit Tests**: Mocked provider tests that run quickly without Azure access.
    ```bash
    terraform -chdir=iac/environment test -test-directory=tests/unit
    ```
-   **Integration Tests**: Plan-only tests that run against a real subscription (requires `az login` and a backend init for the target environment).
    ```bash
    terraform -chdir=iac/environment init -backend-config=../env/<env>.backend.hcl
    terraform -chdir=iac/environment test -test-directory=tests/integration
    ```

## Provider Note

This project uses **AzAPI v2.10** for all resource management. The subscription ID is derived automatically from your active `az login` context (or the OIDC session in CI).
