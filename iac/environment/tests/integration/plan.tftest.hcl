# This file is the INTEGRATION counterpart to tests/unit/stamp.tftest.hcl.
# Unlike the unit tests (which mock_provider every provider for offline runs),
# this test talks to the REAL azapi provider against a real subscription.
# It only PLANs — it never APPLIES — so it is safe to run on a clean
# subscription, but it still requires:
#   * Ambient `az login` so azapi can authenticate.
#   * Provider read access to the shared Application Insights and ACS resources
#     referenced by the mocked shared-state output IDs below.
#
# This file is intentionally excluded from default `terraform test` runs
# (the default `-test-directory=tests` discovery picks up tests/unit/ only
# when invoked explicitly). CI runs unit tests by default; integration is
# an operator-invoked check.
